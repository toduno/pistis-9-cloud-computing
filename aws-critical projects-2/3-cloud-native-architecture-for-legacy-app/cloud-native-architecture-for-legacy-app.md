# Cloud-Native Architecture for Legacy Application

## Scenario 3

As a senior DevOps engineer at company ABC, analyze the existing on-premises infrastructure setup for legacy applications:

_Company ABC has a Virtual Machine  Linux Server with 8GB RAM and 4 VCPU. They have installed a legacy application written in C++, the application is an e-commerce website that has peak traffics during weekends. They have a MYSQL database running on the same server. It has come to the attention of the CTO that the company suffers from serial downtime during their peak period._

Identify the **challenges and shortcomings**, including the single point of failure, lack of scalability, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource allocation. Propose a **solution** that addresses these issues by implementing a cloud-native architecture, separating the database from the application, migrating applications to the cloud while keeping the database on-premises, ensuring proper security measures, and eliminating single points of failure. Provide an **architectural diagram** illustrating the proposed solution and **implement the steps** in detail.

## Challenges and Shortcomings

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPoF)**:
   - The existing setup relies on a single on-premises server for both the application and the database. If this server fails, the entire system goes down.

2. **Lack of Scalability**:
   - During peak traffic, the current server struggles to handle the load. Scalability is essential for accommodating varying workloads.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Combining application and database on one server increases the attack surface.
   - Security measures may not be optimal.

4. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**:
   - Running both application and database on the same server can lead to inefficient resource utilization.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Cloud-Native Architecture

- Migrate the application to the cloud while keeping the database on-premises.
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for the application.
- Implement microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability.

### 2. High-Level Steps

1. **Application Migration**:
   - Containerize the legacy C++ application using Docker.
   - Deploy the containerized application to a cloud-based compute service like Amazon EC2
   - Set up auto-scaling to handle peak traffic.

2. **Database Separation**:
   - Keep the MySQL database on-premises.
   - Establish a secure connection between the cloud application and the on-premises database (e.g., VPN or Direct Connect).

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement network security groups (firewalls) to restrict access to the cloud resources.
   - Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) to manage permissions for cloud services.
   - Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (if applicable).

4. **Eliminate SPoF**:
   - Deploy redundant instances of the application in different availability zones (AZs) within the cloud region.
   - Use a load balancer (e.g., Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across instances.

## Implementation Steps

1. Application Migration:
   - Create an EC2 instance in the cloud.
   - Install Docker and build a Docker image for the legacy application.
   - Deploy the containerized application to the EC2 instance.
   - Set up auto-scaling policies based on traffic patterns.
  
2. Database Connection:
   - Configure a VPN or Direct Connect between on-premises and cloud.
   - Update the application configuration to point to the on-premises database.
  
3. Security Measures:
   - Set up security groups to allow only necessary traffic.
   - Create IAM roles for EC2 instances with appropriate permissions.
   - Enable encryption for data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (if needed).
  
4. Load Balancing:
   - Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the cloud.
   - Add EC2 instances to the load balancer target group.
   - Configure health checks and routing rules.
